Installation
============

Requirements
------------
These requirements must be met:
 - Python 2.6.x or Python 2.7.x. Python 3.x is not supported.
 - CMIS provider compliant with CMIS 1.0 or CMIS 1.1

Steps
-----
 #. If you don't have `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ installed already, do so.
 #. If you don't have `setuptools <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_ installed already, do so.
 #. Once setuptools is installed, type `easy_install cmislib`
 #. That's it!

Once you do that, you should be able to fire up Python on the command-line and import cmislib successfully.

  >>> from cmislib import CmisClient, Repository, Folder

To validate everything is working, run some :ref:`tests` or walk through some :ref:`examples`.
