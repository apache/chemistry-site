Title:     Apache Chemistry Parts

# Welcome to Apache Chemistry Parts


## Introduction

Apache Chemistry Parts is a set of SharePoint components compatible with any CMIS 1.1 compliant repository.

This library contains different sub-components:

* A CMIS 1.1 JavaScript library (based on jQuery)
* 2 UI components (folder tree and document browser) based on the previous library, and using only standard web technologies like HTML, JS and CSS.
* Different SharePoint containers for each previous component: SharePoint 2010 WebParts, SharePoint 2013 WebParts and Office365 AppParts.

These components have been developed to be easily customized depending of your use case, and re-packable for almost any web container.

### Where to get it from

Chemistry Parts has not been released, yet.
